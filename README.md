# hayai - the C++ benchmarking framework.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nickbruun/hayai.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nickbruun/hayai)

_hayai_ is a C++ framework for writing benchmarks for pieces of code along the lines of the normal approach for unit testing using frameworks such as [googletest](http://code.google.com/p/googletest/). For information on the origin of and how to use _hayai_, please read the [introductory blog post](https://nickbruun.dk/2012/02/07/easy-cpp-benchmarking) until I have the time to write a proper README.


## Installing hayai

hayai releases are made available for Mac OS X in [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and for Ubuntu LTS releases in an [Ubuntu PPA](https://launchpad.net/~bruun/+archive/ubuntu/hayai).

To install from Homebrew on Mac OS X:

    $ brew install hayai

To install from the Ubuntu PPA:

    $ apt-add-repository ppa:bruun/hayai
    $ apt-get update
    $ apt-get install libhayai-dev


## Building hayai

_hayai_ is fully header based, but to use the simple `main` function as described in the introducty blog post, the source code must be compiled to provide `libhayai_main`. Compiling the source code requires `CMake` to be present on the system:

    $ cd hayai
    $ cmake .
    $ make

This will also build the sample available in the `sample/` directory of the repository.


## Developing hayai

_hayai_ includes a (currently not at all very comprehensive) test suite for development. To use the test suite, pass a boolean true value as the `TEST` CMake variable:

    $ cd hayai
    $ cmake -DTEST=true .
    $ make
    $ make test
